### Project Description :
* Lane detection can be described as a problem of estimating the lane boundaries by locating
white or yellow markers on the road surface with little knowledge of the road geometry. 
* The hardware for a lane detection system consists of single or multiple cameras that look out of
the front windshield and have a view of the road ahead.
